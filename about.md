Hello! This is my website. But you could probably guess that... It's nice to meet you. Have a look around! See if you enjoy anything that I do too, and have a good day. :)

# About me

Hi! I'm Bιnary198 or BinaryCrown, but you can just call me B198. My pronouns are they/them. I speak English and German. I'm learning French and Chinese. I have **lot** of varied interests. I’m interested in science, computers, logic, linguistics, large numbers and general maths. I also like to watch anime and play video games. I mean, who doesn't?
